# Monster Truck Simulator

## Assumptions

The instructions didn't specify the number of moves that constitutes for a successful simulation, so I assumed the 9 steps in the example would constitute such.

Hence, if the user has navigated 9 times and still haven't hit a wall, the simulation will end successfully.
